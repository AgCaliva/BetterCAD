# BetterCAD
FreeCAD but better UI Design and technologies.
# WIP

I'm frustrated with certain FreeCAD developers whose subpar coding practices and resistance to constructive feedback hinder progress. When issues are identified and improvements proposed, some dismiss these efforts as unnecessary and block contributions, often due to pride rather than objective reasoning. 

As an experienced developer, I believe we can do better. That's why I'm launching BetterCAD, a fork of FreeCAD built on clear, objective principles and open collaboration. Our goal is to create a streamlined, user-focused CAD platform. We'll prioritize clean code, logical decision-making, and meaningful contributions from developers.

Once the initial files are added and unnecessary elements removed, developers are welcome to join and contribute.

For users, BetterCAD will be shaped by your feedbackâ€”your needs will guide our enhancements. In the future, we may even offer different versions tailored to specific user preferences.

To support BetterCAD's development, we currently accept donations in cryptocurrency. Whether you're a developer, user, or supporter, your contributions and encouragement are greatly appreciated. Let's build something better together!
